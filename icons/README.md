# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixel icon for the extension
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon for the extension  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixel icon for the extension

These icons should be created as PNG files with a globe or translation-related design to represent the web translation functionality.

For development purposes, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images as placeholders until proper icons are designed.
